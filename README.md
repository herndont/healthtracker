### Application Description
      This application is going to be the continued ongoing work of multiple labs to create a fitness application. Each day I will add 
      more content to the app and add new features.

#### Lab 26
      Lab 26 consist of creating a home page with a finger fitness button. This button is on a counter to show you just how many reps your
      finger has accomplished. Each rep is literally just touching the counter button, but maybe it will do something more than just
      wearing out your phone.
      
      There is also a carousel of really jacked up pointer fingers to make sure that you are staying really motivated and continue pushing
      through the finger pain.
